## Self-Balancing-Robot

##### The goal of the project is to make a remote-controlled two-wheeled robot, that smoothly and accurately balances on two wheels and may be controlled from a smart phone over bluetooth so that it acts like any other RC-car. The concept is nothing new, and plenty of similar projects can be found in the internet. This kind of project is quite simple in the algorithm level, but still very good exercise in control systems and tuning a controller in practice, as it uses a simple PID-controller to balance itself.
